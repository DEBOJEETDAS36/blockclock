# ⏱️ BlockClock

ChronoStamp is a simple Ethereum smart contract that permanently stores the **block timestamp** of its deployment. It's designed for learning and experimentation with smart contract deployment, constructors, and blockchain-native variables like `block.timestamp`.

## 🧠 What It Does

- Stores the exact time (Unix timestamp) the contract was deployed.
- Provides a public `timestamp()` getter to retrieve it anytime.

🚀 How to Use
Deploy the contract using Remix, Hardhat, or any Ethereum development tool.

After deployment, call timestamp() to get the recorded deployment time.
